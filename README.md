# Minimal YJs - React - Supabase Todo Sample test

Testing basic implementation and functionalities of YJs with a todo react app and a backup on Supabase. Note that supabase is not the source of truth here. It is just doing the job of a bacup server.

## Notes

-   Based on [Minimal-React-Todo-boilerplate](https://github.com/audiBookning/Minimal-React-Todo-boilerplate) and keeping the same oversimplified/minimalist attitude, but using the more fiddly code in the branch "little-more-complex"

-   Unfortunatelly, the more i add, the harder it is to maintain a "easy to follow" code base

-   The `.env.example` file should be renamed to something like `.env.local` (see react docs) and edited with the supabase credentials.

-   In Supabase one needs to create a table named `todos` with the following columns

    ```js
    id: uuid
    title: varchar
    state: bool
    created_at: timestamptz
    updated_at: timestamptz
    ```

-   To test the Webrtc feature of Yjs change the roomName variable in App.jsx to a constant (instead of using UUID) and start 2 different instances of react with `npm start`. Then the changes in one browser window will be reflected in the other.

## Todos (code)

-   The editing property in the todos should be managed only by React, not Yjs.

-   add tests

# Create React App Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
